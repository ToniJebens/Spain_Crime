# Spain_Crime
A dataset from Kaggle that I used last year to practice Exploratory Data Analysis and get started with Time-Series Analysis using Prophet.

About the data:

- Data on crime rate and types of crimes committed in different cities of Spain and in the country on average within 2019 - 2021 years.
- The dataset covers 15 cities.
